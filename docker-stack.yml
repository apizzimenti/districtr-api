version: "3"

# This compose file is for deployment with `docker stack deploy`
# The main difference between docker-compose.yml and this file is
# that we create a volume on the host to persist the database.

# We use the mggg/districtr-api:31 container here as an example.
# When deploying, replace "31" with the tag of the build that you
# want to deploy.

# You will also want to define a `secret_key` Docker secret for
# the api service.
